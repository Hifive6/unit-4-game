This is a number guessing game. Where the user will have to guess using a set a pictures that have a values associated to them that they cannot see. The number on the page will be a randomly generated number and the user score will be placed on the lower block and will add the numbers as the pictures are clicked.

This assignment was for the student (me) to get some practice and hopfully get a better understand of how Jquery works and how to use it for any project that I will be doing in the future.It is important to have  basic understanding as Jquery will probably be used alot moving forward.

You can get started with this game but simply clicking the Rubber Duckys they will show you the values you have and away the game goes.

I will maintaing and contributing to the game. Hopefully my plans in the future is to style the game a little better to make it pop more.
